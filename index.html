         We all make mistakes, but we never expect one wrong move to lead to a tragic scenario. When a family was checking into a
         hotel, they knew they’d only be gone for a minute or two. So, they left their car running only a few feet away from the
         entrance. Their Border Collie named Remy waited in the car while they ran inside.
      
         Remy’s family never expected something to go wrong within a matter of seconds. But in no time, someone took off with the
         car while Remy was still trapped inside. This caused a panic, and the family immediately began searching for their lost
         family member.Rizwan Siwani and his family traveled from southern Minnesota to the Twin Cities for a fun weekend getaway. They would
         stay at the Element Bloomington Mall of America hotel for his son’s upcoming birthday. Since hotels aren’t as busy as
         before the pandemic, Siwani thought Remy would be safe in the car while he checked in. But he didn’t realize his mistake
         until it was too late. While Siwani was checking into the hotel with his kids, the car vanished. Obviously, losing a car is stressful enough,
         but it’s nothing compared to losing a dog. Cars are replaceable, but family members are not. Plus, sweet little Remy
         isn’t even a year old yet.
      
         Siwani quickly filed a police report, desperately hoping that Remy would return home soon. The hotel had surveillance
         footage of the parking lot, but the police said it doesn’t give a clear view of the suspect. Still, the Bloomington
         Police quickly began searching for the stolen dog and vehicle.
         The family feared the car would be abandoned somewhere with Remy still inside, but they refused to give up hope. A few
         days later, officials located the dog in Brooklyn Park. He was all alone, and the vehicle wasn’t in sight. While police
         will continue trying to locate the stolen vehicle, the family is just happy to have their furry friend back. iwani is not bitter about the situation. Instead, he’s just grateful that Remy got a happy ending. Even though the puppy
         hasn’t been a part of the family for long, they already love him unconditionally.
        
         Officers are still looking for Siwani’s car, which is a grey 2017 Kia Sorrento. But for now, Siwani will relax and keep
         a close eye on his loved ones. It is never safe to leave a dog in the car alone, but now he knows that more than anyone.
         We all make mistakes. All that matters is that we learn from them.
